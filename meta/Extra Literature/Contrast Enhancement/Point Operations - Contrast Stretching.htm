<p>
</p><h2>Brief Description</h2>

<p>Contrast stretching (often called normalization) is a simple image
enhancement technique that attempts to improve the contrast in an
image by `stretching' the range of intensity values it contains to
span a desired range of values, <em>e.g.</em> the the full range of
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/value.htm">pixel values</a> that the image type concerned allows. It
differs from the more sophisticated <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/histeq.htm">histogram
equalization</a> in that it can only apply a <em>linear</em> scaling function
to the image pixel values. As a result the `enhancement' is less
harsh. (Most implementations accept a <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/gryimage.htm">graylevel image</a>
as input and produce another graylevel image as output.)

</p><p><a name="how"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/mote.gif"></a></p><h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Before the stretching can be performed it is necessary to specify the
upper and lower pixel value limits over which the image is to be
normalized. Often these limits will just be the minimum and maximum
pixel values that the image type concerned allows. For example for 8-bit
graylevel images the lower and upper limits might be 0 and 255. Call
the lower and the upper limits <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> respectively.

</p><p>The simplest sort of normalization then scans the image to find the
lowest and highest pixel values currently present in the image. Call
these <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>. Then each pixel <em>P</em> is scaled using the
following function:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnstr1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/eqnstr1.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p>Values below 0 are set to 0 and values about 255 are set to 255.

</p><p>The problem with this is that a single outlying pixel with either a
very high or very low value can severely affect the value of <em>c</em> or
<em>d</em> and this could lead to very unrepresentative scaling. Therefore
a more robust approach is to first take a <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/histgram.htm">histogram</a> of
the image, and then select <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> at, say, the 5th and 95th
percentile in the histogram (that is, 5% of the pixel in the histogram
will have values lower than <em>c</em>, and 5% of the pixels will have
values higher than <em>d</em>). This prevents outliers affecting the
scaling so much.

</p><p>Another common technique for dealing with outliers is to use the
intensity histogram to find the most popular intensity level in an
image (<em>i.e.</em> the histogram peak) and then define a <em>cutoff fraction</em>
which is the minimum fraction of this peak magnitude below which data
will be ignored. The intensity histogram is then scanned upward from 0 until
the first intensity value with contents above the cutoff fraction.
This defines <em>c</em>. Similarly, the intensity histogram is then scanned
downward from 255 until the first intensity value with contents above
the cutoff fraction. This defines <em>d</em>.

</p><p>





Some implementations also work with <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/colimage.htm">color images</a>. In this
case all the channels will be stretched using the same offset and
scaling in order to preserve the correct color ratios.

</p><p><a name="guidelines"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/mote.gif"></a></p><h2>Guidelines for Use</h2>

<p>Normalization is commonly used to improve the contrast in an image
without distorting relative graylevel intensities too significantly.

</p><p>We begin by considering an image 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1.gif"><img alt="wom1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> which can easily be
enhanced by the most simple of contrast stretching implementations
because the <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/histgram.htm">intensity histogram</a> forms a tight, narrow
cluster between the graylevel intensity values of 79 - 136, as shown
in 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1hst1.gif"><img alt="wom1hst1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1hst1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> After contrast stretching, using a simple
linear interpolation between <em>c = 79</em> and <em>d = 136</em>, we obtain

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1str1.gif"><img alt="wom1str1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1str1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> Compare the histogram of the original image with
that of the contrast-stretched version 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1hst2.gif"><img alt="wom1hst2" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1hst2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p>

</p><p>While this result is a significant improvement over the original, the
enhanced image itself still appears somewhat flat.
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/histeq.htm">Histogram equalizing</a> the image increases contrast
dramatically, but yields an artificial-looking result

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1heq1.gif"><img alt="wom1heq1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1heq1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> In this case, we can achieve better
results by contrast stretching the image over a more narrow range of
graylevel values from the original image. For example, by setting the
cutoff fraction parameter to 0.03, we obtain the contrast-stretched
image 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1str2.gif"><img alt="wom1str2" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1str2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> and its corresponding histogram

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1hst3.gif"><img alt="wom1hst3" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1hst3.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> Note that this operation has effectively
spread out the information contained in the original histogram peak
(thus improving contrast in the interesting face regions) by pushing
those intensity levels to the left of the peak down the histogram
<em>x</em>-axis towards 0. Setting the cutoff fraction to a higher value,
<em>e.g.</em> 0.125, yields the contrast stretched image

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1str3.gif"><img alt="wom1str3" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1str3.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> As shown in the histogram

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/wom1hst4.gif"><img alt="wom1hst4" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/wom1hst4.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> most of the information to the left of
the peak in the original image is mapped to 0 so that the peak can
spread out even further and begin pushing values to its right up to
255.

</p><p>As an example of an image which is more difficult to enhance, consider

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2.gif"><img alt="moo2" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/moo2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> which shows a low contrast image of a lunar surface.

</p><p>The image 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2hst2.gif"><img alt="moo2hst2" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/moo2hst2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> shows the intensity histogram of this
image. Note that only part of the <em>y</em>-axis has been shown for
clarity. The minimum and maximum values in this 8-bit image are 0 and
255 respectively, and so straightforward normalization to the range
0&nbsp;-&nbsp;255 produces absolutely no effect. However, we <em>can</em> enhance the
picture by ignoring all pixel values outside the 1% and 99%
percentiles, and only applying contrast stretching to those pixels in
between. The outliers are simply forced to either 0 or 255 depending
upon which side of the range they lie on.

</p><p>
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2str1.gif"><img alt="moo2str1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/moo2str1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> shows the result of this enhancement. Notice that
the contrast has been significantly improved. Compare this with the
corresponding enhancement achieved using <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/histeq.htm">histogram
equalization</a>.

</p><p>Normalization can also be used when converting from one <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/value.htm">image type</a> to
another, for instance from floating point pixel values to 8-bit
integer pixel values. As an example the pixel values in the floating
point image might run from 0 to 5000. Normalizing this range to 0-255
allows easy conversion to 8-bit integers. Obviously some information
might be lost in the compression process, but the relative intensities
of the pixels will be preserved.

</p><h2>Exercises</h2>

<p></p><ol>
<li> Derive the scaling formula given above from the parameters
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>.

<p></p></li><li> Suppose you had to normalize an 8-bit image to one in which the
pixel values were stored as 4-bit integers. What would be a suitable
destination range (<em>i.e.</em> the values of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>)?

<p></p></li><li> Contrast-stretch the image 
<blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/sap1.gif"><img alt="sap1" src="./Point Operations - Contrast Stretching_files/sap1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> (You must begin by
selecting suitable values for <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>.) Next, edge-detect
(<em>i.e.</em> using the <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/sobel.htm">Sobel</a>, <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/roberts.htm">Roberts Cross</a> or
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/canny.htm">Canny</a> edge detector) both the original and the contrast
stretched version. Does contrast stretching increase the number of edges
which can be detected?

</p><p></p></li><li> Imagine you have an image taken in low light levels and which, as
a result, has low contrast. What are the advantages of using contrast
stretching to improve the contrast, rather than simply
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/pixmult.htm">scaling</a> the image by a factor of, say, three?
