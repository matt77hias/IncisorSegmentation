</p><h2>Brief Description</h2>

<p><a name="2"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/mote.gif"></a>Histogram modeling techniques (<em>e.g.</em> histogram equalization) provide a
sophisticated method for modifying the dynamic range and contrast of
an image by altering that image such that its <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/histgram.htm">intensity
histogram</a> has a desired shape. Unlike <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/stretch.htm">contrast
stretching</a>, histogram modeling operators may employ <em>non-linear</em>
and <em>non-monotonic</em> transfer functions to map between <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/value.htm">pixel
intensity values</a> in the input and output images.  Histogram
equalization employs a monotonic, non-linear mapping which re-assigns
the intensity values of pixels in the input image such that the output
image contains a uniform distribution of intensities (<em>i.e.</em> a flat
histogram). This technique is used in image comparison processes
(because it is effective in detail enhancement) and in the correction
of non-linear effects introduced by, say, a digitizer or display
system.

</p><p><a name="how"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/mote.gif"></a></p><h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Histogram modeling is usually introduced using continuous, rather
than discrete, process functions. Therefore, we suppose that the
images of interest contain continuous intensity levels (in the
interval [0,1]) and that the transformation function <em>f</em>
which maps an input image <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq2" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq2.gif" align="middle"> onto an output image
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq3" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq3.gif" align="middle"> is continuous within this interval.  Further,
it will be assumed that the transfer law (which may also be written in
terms of intensity density levels, <em>e.g.</em> <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq4" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq4.gif" align="middle">)
is single-valued and monotonically increasing (as is the case in
histogram equalization) so that it is possible to define the inverse
law <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq5" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq5.gif" align="middle">. An example of such a transfer
function is illustrated in Figure 1.

<br>

<p>All pixels in the input image with densities in the region
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq6" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq6.gif" align="middle"> to <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq7" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq7.gif" align="middle"> will have their pixel
values re-assigned such that they assume an output pixel density value
in the range from <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq8" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq8.gif" align="middle"> to <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq9" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq9.gif" align="middle">. The
surface areas <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq10" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq10.gif" align="middle"> and
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq11" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq11.gif" align="middle"> will therefore be equal, yielding:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq12" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq12.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p>where <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq12a" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq12a.gif" align="middle">.

</p><p>This result can be written in the language of probability theory if
the histogram <em>h</em> is regarded as a continuous
probability density function <em>p</em> describing the
distribution of the (assumed random) intensity levels:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq15" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq15.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of histogram equalization, the output probability
densities should all be an equal fraction of the maximum number of
intensity levels in the input image <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq16" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq16.gif" align="middle"> (where the
minimum level considered is 0). The <a name="3"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/mote.gif"></a>transfer function (or point
operator) necessary to achieve this result is simply:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq17" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq17.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore,

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq18" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq18.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p>where <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq19" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq19.gif" align="middle"> is simply the cumulative probability
distribution (<em>i.e.</em> cumulative histogram) of the original image.
<em>Thus, an image which is transformed using its cumulative histogram
yields an output histogram which is flat!</em>

</p><p>A digital implementation of histogram equalization is usually
performed by defining a transfer function of the form:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq20" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq20.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p>where <em>N</em> is the number of image pixels and
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq22" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq22.gif" align="middle"> is the number of pixels at intensity level k or
less.

</p><p>In the digital implementation, the output image will not necessarily
be fully equalized and there may be `holes' in the histogram (<em>i.e.</em>
unused intensity levels).  These effects are likely to decrease as the
number of pixels and intensity quantization levels in the input image
are increased.

</p><p><a name="guidelines"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/mote.gif"></a></p><h2>Guidelines for Use</h2>

<p>To illustrate the utility of histogram equalization, consider

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2.gif"><img alt="moo2" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/moo2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> which shows an <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/gryimage.htm">8-bit grayscale image</a> of the surface of
the moon. The histogram 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2hst2.gif"><img alt="moo2hst2" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/moo2hst2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> confirms what we can see
by visual inspection: this image has poor dynamic range. (Note that we
can view this histogram as a description of pixel probability
densities by simply scaling the vertical axis by the total number of
image pixels and normalizing the horizontal axis using the number of
intensity density levels (<em>i.e.</em> 256). However, the shape of the
distribution will be the same in either case.)

</p><p>In order to improve the contrast of this image, without affecting the
structure (<em>i.e.</em> geometry) of the information contained therein, we can
apply the histogram equalization operator. The resulting image is

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2heq1.gif"><img alt="moo2heq1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/moo2heq1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> and its histogram is shown

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2hst1.gif"><img alt="moo2hst1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/moo2hst1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p>  Note that the histogram is not flat (as in
the examples from the continuous case) but that the dynamic range and
contrast have been enhanced. Note also that when equalizing images
with narrow histograms and relatively few gray levels, increasing the
dynamic range has the adverse effect of increasing visual grainyness.
Compare this result with that produced by the linear
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/stretch.htm">contrast stretching</a> operator 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/moo2str1.gif"><img alt="moo2str1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/moo2str1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p>

</p><p>In order to further explore the transformation defined by the
histogram equalization operator, consider the image of the Scott
Monument in Edinburgh, Scotland 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1.gif"><img alt="bld1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> Although the contrast
on the building is acceptable, the sky region is represented almost
entirely by light pixels. This causes most histogram pixels

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1hst1.gif"><img alt="bld1hst1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1hst1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> to be pushed into a narrow peak in the upper
graylevel region. The histogram equalization operator defines a
mapping based on the cumulative histogram 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1cuh1.gif"><img alt="bld1cuh1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1cuh1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> which
results in the image 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1heq1.gif"><img alt="bld1heq1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1heq1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> While histogram equalization
has enhanced the contrast of the sky regions in the image, the picture
now looks artificial because there is very little variety in the middle
graylevel range.
This occurs because the transfer
function is based on the shallow slope of the cumulative histogram in
the middle graylevel regions (<em>i.e.</em> intensity density levels 100&nbsp;-&nbsp;230)
and causes many pixels from this region in the original image to be
mapped to similar graylevels in the output image.

</p><p>We can improve on this if we define a mapping based on a sub-section
of the image which contains a better distribution of intensity
densities from the low and middle range graylevels. If we crop the
image so as to isolate a region which contains more building than sky

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1crp1.gif"><img alt="bld1crp1" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1crp1.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> we can then define a histogram equalization
mapping for the whole image based on the cumulative histogram

</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1cuh2.gif"><img alt="bld1cuh2" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1cuh2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> of this smaller region. Since the cropped
image contains a more even distribution of dark and light pixels, the
slope of the transfer function is steeper and smoother, and the
contrast of the resulting image 
</p><blockquote><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/images/bld1heq2.gif"><img alt="bld1heq2" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/bld1heq2.GIF"></a></blockquote>
<p> is more natural.
This idea of defining mappings based upon particular sub-sections of
the image is taken up by another class of operators which perform
<em>Local Enhancements</em> as discussed below.

</p><p></p><h2>Common Variants</h2>

<p><a name="4"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/mote.gif"></a><em>Histogram Specification</em>

</p><p>Histogram equalization is limited in that it is capable of producing
only one result: an image with a uniform intensity distribution.
Sometimes it is desirable to be able to control the shape of the
output histogram in order to highlight certain intensity levels in an
image. This can be accomplished by the histogram specialization
operator which maps a given intensity distribution
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq23" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq23.gif" align="middle"> into a desired distribution
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq24" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq24.gif" align="middle"> using a histogram equalized image
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq25" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq25.gif" align="middle"> as an intermediate stage.

</p><p>The first step in histogram specialization, is to specify the desired
output density function and write a transformation
<em>g(c)</em>.  If <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq27" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq27.gif" align="middle"> is single-valued
(which is true when there are no unfilled levels in the specified
histogram or errors in the process of rounding off
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq28" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq28.gif" align="middle"> to the nearest intensity level), then <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq29" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq29.gif" align="middle"> defines a mapping from the equalized levels of the
original image, <img alt="Eqn:eqnheq30" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq30.gif" align="middle">. It is possible to
combine these two transformations such that the image need not be
histogram equalized explicitly:

</p><p></p><blockquote>
<img alt="Eqn:eqnheq31" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/eqnheq31.gif" align="bottom">
</blockquote>

<p><a name="5"><img alt="" src="./Point Operations - Histogram Equalization_files/mote.gif"></a><em>Local Enhancements</em>

</p><p>The histogram processing methods discussed above are global in the
sense that they apply a transformation function whose form is based
on the intensity level distribution of an entire image. Although this
method can enhance the overall contrast and dynamic range of an image
(thereby making certain details more visible), there are cases in
which enhancement of details over small areas (<em>i.e.</em> areas whose total
pixel contribution to the total number of image pixels has a
negligible influence on the global transform) is desired. The solution
in these cases is to derive a transformation based upon the intensity
distribution in the local neighborhood of every pixel in the image.

</p><p>The histogram processes described above can be adapted for local
enhancement. The procedure involves defining a neighborhood around
each pixel and, using the histogram characteristics of this
neighborhood, to derive a transfer function which maps that pixel into
an output intensity level. This is performed for each pixel in the
image. (Since moving across rows or down columns only adds one new
pixel to the local histogram, updating the histogram from the previous
calculation with new data introduced at each motion is possible.)
Local enhancement may also define transforms based on pixel attributes
other than histogram, <em>e.g.</em> intensity mean (to control variance) and
variance (to control contrast) are common.
